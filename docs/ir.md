# Mango IR

## What am I looking for?

- Mid to low level; should be pretty easy to implement optimization like constant folding, reallocating memory used by dead variables, loop invariance hoisting, jump optimizations and such.
- Ideally text-based/human-readable but not a necessity.
- As target agnostic as possible
